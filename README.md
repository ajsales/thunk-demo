# Pokemon Thunk Demo

This is a small pokemon-themed application to demonstrate Redux and Thunk in React. It is an extension of my [previous Redux demo](https://github.com/ajsales/redux-demo), which had pokemon sprites saved locally; instead, this app makes network requests for the sprites.

Run locally with "npm start". It should be located at http://localhost:3000.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
